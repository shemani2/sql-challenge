# sql-challenge
# when working on this challenge, I got help from the solved activities for Module 9. I used them to model the code and ran into a few errors.
# by fixing the errors and conferring with other similar repos on github, I was able to determine my errors such as noting that some of the columns were a combination of varying characters and not solely integer which is why the tables would not upload and the queries would not work.
